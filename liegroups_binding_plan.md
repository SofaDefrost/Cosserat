# Plan for Completing the LieGroups Python Bindings

1.  **Finalize Core Bindings:**
    *   Review and complete the existing bindings for `SO(2)`, `SO(3)`, `SE(2)`, and `SE(3)` to ensure all necessary methods are exposed, including constructors, group operations (`*`, `inverse`), Lie algebra functions (`exp`, `log`, `adjoint`), and the group action (`act`).

2.  **Bind Additional Lie Groups:**
    *   Implement bindings for the `SGal(3)` and `SE(2,3)` groups, following the same structure as the existing bindings.

3.  **Bind the `Bundle` Class:**
    *   Since the C++ `Bundle` class is a template, I will create Python bindings for common, useful instantiations. I'll start with a `Bundle` of `SE(3)` and `R^6` (representing a rigid body's state) as a primary example. This will involve:
        *   Exposing a constructor to create bundles from Python.
        *   Providing `get` and `set` methods to access individual groups within a bundle.
        *   Binding the bundle's group operations.

4.  **Expose Utility Functions:**
    *   Bind any C++ utility functions, such as `interpolate` for spherical linear interpolation (slerp) between group elements.

5.  **Create Comprehensive Python Tests:**
    *   Develop a suite of Python tests to validate the bindings. These tests will:
        *   Verify that Lie group objects can be created and manipulated from Python.
        *   Check that the results of group operations in Python match the expected mathematical behavior.
        *   Ensure that exceptions are correctly thrown for invalid operations.

6.  **Refine Build System & Documentation:**
    *   Update the `CMakeLists.txt` files to correctly build and link the new binding code.
    *   Add docstrings to the Python classes and functions to make them easy to use and understand from Python.
