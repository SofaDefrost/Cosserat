_Welcome to this tutorial on SOFA-Cosserat Plugin._

_Outline of what participants can expect to learn during this tutorial ?_

---

## **1. [[Introduction]]**
   - Briefly introduce the field of soft robotics
   - Explain the motivation for combining FEM and DCM models.

---

**2. [[Background Concepts]]**
   - An overview of Discrete Cosserat Model (DCM) and their relevance in soft robotics.
   - Finite Element Methods (FEM) and their use in simulating deformable structures ?
   - The concept of compliance matrices and their role in soft robot modeling ?

---

**3. [[Setting up the Environment]]**
   - The software tools and libraries used (SOFA, **Cosserat** plugin).
   - Instructions for setting up the simulation environment.

---
**4. [[Direct Simulation]]**
   - How to 
	   - Build the DCM scene ?
	   - Integrate it with FEM for the soft body ?
   - The direct simulation of a soft robot (e.g., the gripper example from the paper).
   - The role of constraints, friction, and contact forces.

---

**5. [[Inverse Simulation]]**
   - Demonstrate an inverse simulation for soft robots (e.g., using the soft finger or tentacle as examples).
   - Explain how to compute actuation values to achieve desired end-effector positions.
   - Discuss the handling of sliding constraints in the inverse problem.

---

**6. [[Model Convergence and Sensitivity Analysis]]**
   - Here we will share insights on how to evaluate the convergence of your model with varying parameters 
	   - e.g., number of sections defining a cable
   - Discuss sensitivity to material properties and other simulation parameters.

---

**7. [[Advanced Topics and Future Work]]**
   - Explore potential applications of your method in soft robot design.
