Last updated: May 29, 2025

## Completed Improvements (May 29, 2025)

The following improvements have been made to `CosseratBase.py`:

### 1. Documentation Improvements ✅

- ✅ Added comprehensive docstrings to all methods
- ✅ Enhanced the class docstring with detailed parameter descriptions
- ✅ Addressed TODO comment by implementing proper method naming

### 2. Type Hints ✅

- ✅ Added proper type hints to all methods
- ✅ Made type hints more specific by using concrete types
- ✅ Added return type hints to all methods

### 3. Error Handling ✅

- ✅ Added validation of input parameters in `__init__`
- ✅ Added proper error messages for missing required parameters

### 4. Code Style ✅

- ✅ Made method naming consistent by converting all to snake_case
- ✅ Formatted code according to PEP 8 guidelines using Black
- ✅ Fixed line length issues by properly breaking long lines

### 5. Best Practices ✅

- ✅ Removed empty `init()` method
- ✅ Implemented `__repr__` method for better debugging
- ✅ Replaced print statements with logging

### 6. Bug Fixes ✅

- ✅ Replaced print statements with proper logging

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Code Organization

- [ ] Move the `Params` variable and `createScene` function to a separate file
- [ ] Consider splitting the class into smaller components for better separation of concerns

### 2. Best Practices

- [ ] Consider making some private methods truly private using double underscores
- [ ] Add a `__str__` method in addition to the implemented `__repr__`

### 3. Performance Improvements

- [ ] Cache computed values that are used multiple times
- [ ] Vectorize operations using numpy where applicable

### 4. Additional Enhancements

- [ ] Convert magic numbers to named constants
- [ ] Add unit tests for the class
- [ ] Add more comprehensive error handling for object creation
- [ ] Consider implementing a factory pattern for creating different beam types
