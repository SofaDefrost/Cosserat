# Plan for Improving the Cosserat Plugin Repository

Below is a step-by-step plan for addressing the recommendations related to code organization, documentation, design, implementation, build system, quality assurance, development process, and performance.

## 1. Code Organization

- **Archive Experimental Code**  
  Move experimental and outdated code to a separate “archive/experimental” folder to keep the core codebase clean.
- **Restructure Tests**  
  Create a top-level “tests” directory to store all unit tests, integration tests, and benchmarking tests separately.
- **Reorganize Examples**  
  Introduce a more structured example directory with categorized subfolders (e.g., “forcefield_examples”, “mapping_examples”) for clarity.

## 2. Documentation

- **Add Top-Level README**  
  Provide a high-level overview of the project, including goals, usage, and main features.
- **Establish Contribution Guidelines**  
  Create a CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines on coding style, pull requests, and conduct expectations.
- **Standardize Documentation**  
  Ensure each module uses a consistent format (e.g., doxygen or Sphinx), with inline comments for complex algorithms.
- **Architectural Diagrams**  
  Develop diagrams illustrating how modules (liegroups, forcefield, mapping, etc.) interact with one another to provide clarity.

## 3. Design

- **Force Field Factory Pattern**  
  Implement a factory class to create different force field objects with minimal changes to client code.
- **Compile-Time Checks**  
  Use static assertions and stronger type aliases to catch mistakes early in template-based code.
- **Error Handling**  
  Introduce consistent error codes or exception handling for invalid states and input.
- **PIMPL Idiom**  
  Apply the PIMPL pattern to large classes where ABI stability and compile-time optimization are critical.

## 4. Implementation

- **Expand Test Coverage**  
  Add more unit tests for each module and integrate them into CI pipelines.
- **Continuous Integration**  
  Adopt CI (e.g., GitHub Actions or GitLab CI) to run builds, tests, and static analysis automatically.
- **Performance Benchmarking**  
  Include a dedicated benchmarking suite for critical math operations and force field calculations.
- **Smart Pointers**  
  Replace raw pointers with std::unique_ptr or std::shared_ptr, ensuring better memory safety.
- **Thread Safety Documentation**  
  Clearly document which parts of the code are thread-safe and outline best practices for multi-thread usage.

## 5. Build System

- **Versioning & Installation**  
  Add version numbering in CMake and set up install targets for library headers and binaries.
- **Package Configuration Files**  
  Provide Config.cmake files for easy usage by consumers of the library.
- **Conan or vcpkg**  
  Consider adopting a package manager to streamline dependency management.

## 6. Quality Assurance

- **Automatic Code Formatting**  
  Integrate a tool (e.g., clang-format) or rely on user’s environment (e.g., conform.nvim, nvim-lint) for consistent formatting.
- **Static Analysis**  
  Add tools like clang-tidy or cppcheck to detect potential bugs.
- **Code Coverage**  
  Use coverage tools (e.g., gcov or lcov) to track and report test coverage.
- **Systematic Benchmark Testing**  
  Expand existing benchmarks to measure performance across multiple configurations.

## 7. Development Process

- **Issue Templates**  
  Provide structured templates for bug reports and feature requests, prepopulated with required information fields.
- **Release Process & Changelogs**  
  Maintain versioned releases with documented changes and new features in changelogs.
- **Semantic Versioning**  
  Follow a semantic versioning scheme (major.minor.patch) to communicate breaking changes and compatibility.
- **Pull Request Templates**  
  Encourage thorough descriptions of changes, testing instructions, and rationale in PR templates.
- **Automated Dependency Updates**  
  Deploy bots or scripts to periodically check and update dependencies.

## 8. Performance

- **Systematic Benchmarks**  
  Set up a dedicated suite to compare the performance of different algorithms and force fields over time.
- **Profiling**  
  Use profiling tools (e.g., Valgrind, perf, or Instruments on macOS) on critical code paths.
- **Performance Documentation**  
  Document expected performance characteristics for each module and provide guidance for optimization.
- **SIMD Optimization**  
  Evaluate feasibility of using SIMD operations in core math routines for additional speed-ups.
