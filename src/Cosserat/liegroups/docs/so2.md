# SO(2) Implementation

## Overview

`SO2<Scalar>` implements the Special Orthogonal group in 2D, which represents rotations in a plane. SO(2) is a 1-dimensional Lie group, where the dimension corresponds to the angle of rotation.

## Mathematical Properties

- **Dimension**: 1 (the angle θ)
- **Group operation**: composition of rotations
- **Identity element**: rotation by 0 radians
- **Inverse**: rotation by -θ
- **Lie algebra**: so(2), which is isomorphic
