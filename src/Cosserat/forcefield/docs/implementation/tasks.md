1. Create the Base Class Files
   • Add "BaseBeamHookeLawForceField.h" and "BaseBeamHookeLawForceField.inl" files in the appropriate module directory.
   • Declare an abstract template class "BaseBeamHookeLawForceField" inheriting from "ForceField<DataTypes>".
   • Ensure the base class defines necessary template parameters (Vec3Types, Vec6Types).

2. Identify Common Data Members and Methods
   • Review BeamHookeLawForceField and BeamHookeLawForceFieldRigid to extract shared properties:

   - Cross-section shape (rectangular, circular, etc.) and dimensions.
   - Area calculation logic.
   - Material properties (Young’s modulus, Poisson ratio).
   - Inertia parameters and section variants.
     • Move these members and any relevant getter/setter methods into "BaseBeamHookeLawForceField".
     • Add checks in the base class’s constructor to ensure valid parameter bounds, with clear error messages.

3. Integrate LieGroups (SO3, SE3)
   • Update the base class to utilize SO3 and SE3 for rotation, transformation, and strain/stress mapping.
   • Introduce placeholders or utility methods in the base class that you’ll rely on to handle frame transformations in derived classes.

4. Code Duplication Removal
   • Move any duplicated constructor initialization code from BeamHookeLawForceField and BeamHookeLawForceFieldRigid into the base class constructor or a common initialization method.
   • Extract duplicated logic from reinit(), addForce(), addDForce(), and addKToMatrix() into virtual or protected methods in the base class.
   • Provide pure virtual methods in the base class for specialized force calculations that differ between the two derived classes.

5. Maintain Backward Compatibility
   • Keep original class names (BeamHookeLawForceField and BeamHookeLawForceFieldRigid) and data member names.
   • In the derived classes, inherit from the new "BaseBeamHookeLawForceField".
   • Add deprecation warnings to any methods or signatures that are changed to highlight the new usage, without breaking existing code.
   • Ensure that the original public interface in the derived classes remains consistent with previously existing calls.

6. Implement Enhanced Error Handling
   • Add a thorough validation routine in the base class to verify cross-section dimensions, Young’s modulus ranges, Poisson ratio limits, etc.
   • Improve error messaging to indicate which parameter is invalid and why.
   • Make sure derived classes complement the base class’s error checking with additional checks specific to rigid or non-rigid beams.

7. File and Build Updates
   • Modify "BeamHookeLawForceField.h/.cpp/.inl" and "BeamHookeLawForceFieldRigid.h/.cpp/.inl" to:

   - Include "BaseBeamHookeLawForceField.h"
   - Extend "BaseBeamHookeLawForceField" instead of "ForceField<DataTypes>" directly.
   - Remove any redundant code now handled by the base class.
     • Ensure all CMake or build-related scripts reference "BaseBeamHookeLawForceField" if necessary for registration.
     • Maintain existing component registration macros for each derived class within SOFA.

8. Testing & Validation
   • Compile and run existing unit tests for BeamHookeLawForceField and BeamHookeLawForceFieldRigid to ensure no regressions.
   • Add new tests for base class validation logic, including boundary condition tests on cross-section and material properties.
   • Ensure transformations using SO3/SE3 behave as expected across strain/stress calculations.

9. Documentation & Final Review
   • Update or create Doxygen documentation for "BaseBeamHookeLawForceField" with details on common data members and usage.
   • Document any new or deprecated interfaces in the derived classes.
   • Verify that the code merges cleanly and passes all checks in the CI pipeline.
