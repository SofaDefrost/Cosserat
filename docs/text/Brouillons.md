**Overview** 
Remember to make the tutorial interactive, engage the participants, and provide opportunities for questions and discussions. You may also consider sharing the tutorial materials, code, and relevant resources with participants for further learning and experimentation.

---
**Partie 1:** 
Each slide should be visually engaging with relevant images, diagrams, and minimal text. You can also use this opportunity to set the tone for the tutorial, making it clear that participants are embarking on an exciting journey into the world of soft robotics simulations.

---
**Partie 2:** 
Each slide should be visually appealing, with clear and concise explanations. Make use of diagrams, images, and bullet points to enhance understanding. The aim is to provide participants with a solid foundation in the background concepts essential for grasping the hybrid FEM and DCM approach.
