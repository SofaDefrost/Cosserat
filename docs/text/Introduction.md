## Introduction to Soft Robotics (SR)

- Soft robotics is an emerging and innovative field of robotics 
- Focuses on the design and development of robots made from :  
	- *Flexible*, 
	- *Deformable*,
	- *Compliant materials*.

## Introduction to Soft Robotics (SR)
- Numerous advantages
	- *Adaptability* : Their ability to deform and adapt to their environment
	- *Safety* : Ideal for interactions with humans, delicate objects, or unstructured surroundings
	- *Versatility* : Various applications

---
##  **Key Applications**

- *Healthcare* : The gentle and non-invasive nature of SR is necessary
- *Industrial automation* : The high [Compliance](../../../Soft_Robot/Compliance.md), reduces the risk of damage during interactions with products
- *Search and rescue* : they can navigate through tight spaces and uneven terrains
- *Space exploration*, and *extreme environments*

## **Challenges in Soft Robotics**

- *Modeling* : due to deformable materials
- [*Control*](../../../Soft_Robot/kinematics_dynamics_control.md) : due to the non-linear, multi-body dynamics of deformable materials
- [*Multi-dimension*](../../../../../../Projects/ANR/brainStormingANR2023.md) : due to a wide range of shape, volume (3D), surface (2D) and cable (1D)
- [*Multi-physics*](../../../../../../Projects/ANR/RobotMulti-physics.md) : due a wide range of physical behaviors, including mechanical deformation, thermal effects, electrical responses,

## **Challenges in Soft Robotics**

- Addressing these challenges is crucial for the widespread adoption of soft robots in various fields.

## [FEM and DCM](../../_docs/DCM_FEM.md) 

- *FEM's Material Modeling*: FEM excels at modeling the deformations and stress distributions in complex materials, including soft and deformable ones. It considers the local behavior of materials, making it more accurate for understanding the mechanical properties of soft robots.
- *Cosserat theory's Beam-Like Modeling*: DCM, on the other hand, is suitable for modeling the overall shape and bending of structures, making it a natural choice for cables, rods, and flexible elements in soft robots.

## Motivation for the combination of the two models

- *Combined Accuracy*: By combining FEM and DCM, you can leverage the strengths of both methods. FEM provides fine-grained material modeling, while DCM captures the shape and motion of deformable elements accurately. This leads to a more realistic representation of the entire robot's behavior.

- *Unified Simulation Framework*:A combined FEM-DCM framework creates a unified simulation environment that can model both the deformable body of the robot (using FEM) and the actuation components (using DCM). This simplifies simulation setup and control algorithms.
