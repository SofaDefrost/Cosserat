title: DCM-FEM for Soft-Robot modeling Tutorial
tags:
  - tutorial
Audience: Researchers, engineers, and students interested in soft robotics and the simulation of deformable robots.
Duration: This tutorial can vary in duration based on the depth and complexity of the material, but a typical plan could span 2-4 hours.
Prerequisites: Participants should have a basic understanding of robotics, mechanics, and computer simulations. Knowledge of finite element methods (FEM) and rigid body dynamics can be helpful.
